#### Just overlapping circles with attention to detail.
- All the circles are drawn point by point for more control.
- The curves are deliberately not smooth. Gives it a raw feeling that i like.
- Notice how no circle has its center hidden behind another circle. Its subtle but it adds character and order to an otherwise fairly random sketch.

In version 2, added another subtlety that the colour of a circle will never be same as its closest neighbour. This looks really cool when there is a circle entirely inside another circle.

suggest some colour combinations if you will.
