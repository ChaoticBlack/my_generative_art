## What I've Done
- Basically there are 2 types of particles, red and blue. I wrote a bit of physics for these particles. Particles of the same colour repel and particles of opposite colours attract.
- Once this basic setup is ready, I initialize an amount of randomly generated particles on the canvas and trace their paths.
- If the inital positions are deliberately assigned to be a closely knit 2D matrix, then the result looks like an organism growing naturally.
